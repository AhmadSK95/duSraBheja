4. I want a way to work with my code base and also check the status on multiple projects on my GitHub.
5. One place I can interact with my Claude or Antigravity or my Codex agent or multiple agents to work on a project, and a way to control this, and a way to interact with this system through my WhatsApp.
6. I want this system to be brains connected to brains connected to agents.
7. I want it safe and a real command center tool that acts as my second brain.
8. I want it executing things offline for me and giving me updates and statuses on them.
9. I want it to keep track of ideas and then create action plans.
10. I want a way to run autonomously using our brains.
11. I want the best intelligence framework, including aggressive and experimental technology.
12. I want research that goes through Google DeepMind research and compares existing ways, then proposes a novel approach.
13. I have a Mac Pro with API keys for ChatGPT, Anthropic, and Gemini.
14. I have an iPhone 14 with the same access and WhatsApp.
15. I am open to buying cloud servers if needed, but I want something locally intelligent rather than infra-driven.

## User Prompt (Provided Directly)
- "Create a 2 docs - one outlining the requirements of product like a product manager and a prompt doc that stores this above 5 points and the above 29 points identified from the video and video link as a source of truth from me the user, the prompt doc will only contain details from research, notes from me and prompts given by me - none of your decisions just my truths."
- "I want this system to be brains connected to brains connected to agents and I want it safe and is a real command center tool that acts as my second brain executing things offline for me and giving me updates and statuses on them and keeps a track of ideas, then creates actions plans and a way to run autonomously using ours brains - again I want the best intelligence framework cuthroat technnology even experimental like go through google deep minds reasearch and compare all the existing ways and compare and come up with a novel approach - I have a mac pro with api keys to chat gpt, anthropic, gemini if needed , iphone 14 with the same accesss and whatsapp, but design me something that really is running 24/7 if we need to buy cloud servers that is fine but come up with something locally intelligent rather than infra driven - Dig deep into the web and theorize all solutions and come up with something that stickls the best - get cracking"
